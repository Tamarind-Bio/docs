# Point Mutations

It's difficult for current state of the art models to capture differences in point mutations. We recommend ALDE if you have some point mutations and want to find what others to test.

## Small Datasets

For antibody datasets with a heavy and light chain, we offer an Antibody finetuning tool, which uses embeddings from Antiberty for regression and classification. Simply select the columns for your sequence, property, and job name, and we'll create a custom model for your use case. You can then find this model in the "My Models" tab on the main page, and use it for inference on another dataset.

## Large Datasets (30,000+ data points)

Reach out to us to use AlphaBind, currently on a per request basis.
