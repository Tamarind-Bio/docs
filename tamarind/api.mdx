description: 'Access our tools programatically'

All of our tools accessible via REST API. Here are the available endpoints:
  
* **/submit-job** (POST) - Submit individual jobs
* **/submit-batch** (POST) - Submit batch jobs by specifying the settings of each subjob
* **/jobs** (GET) - Retrieve jobs
* **/results** (POST) - Retrieve results
* **/upload** (PUT) - Upload files to use in jobs
* **/files** (GET) - Retrieve uploaded input files

When referencing our API docs, each tool has required settings checked by default. You can select additional settings to interactively construct your parameters. 

Some tools also have tasks, which allow for different combinations of settings to use the same tool. One common example is a different task for antibody inputs vs. nanobody inputs, such as in immunebuilder.

For tools which take file inputs, you can either first use our /upload endpoint to upload the file to your account, or include the file contents directly in your request.
