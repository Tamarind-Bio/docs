description: 'Access our tools programatically'
---

We make all of our tools accessible via our REST API. Here are the available endpoints:

* **/submit-job** (POST) - Submit individual jobs
* **/submit-batch** (POST) - Submit batch jobs by specifying the settings of each subjob
* **/jobs** (GET) - Retrieve jobs
* **/results** (POST) - Retrieve results
* **/upload** (PUT) - Upload files to use in jobs
* **/files** (GET) - Retrieve uploaded input files

Each tool has required settings checked by default, and you can select additional settings to interactively construct your parameters. An example for AlphaFold is shown below. 

Some tools also have tasks, which allow for different combinations of settings to use the same tool. One common example is a different task for antibody inputs vs. nanobody inputs, such as in immunebuilder.
