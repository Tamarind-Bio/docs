## Binder Design

RFdiffusion can be used to design protein binders that target specific protein surfaces. This task involves generating novel protein sequences that can bind to a target protein of interest. The process leverages diffusion models to sample from the space of possible protein structures and sequences.

### Required Parameters
- **PDB File** (`pdbFile`): Input PDB file containing the target structure
- **Target Chains** (`targetChains`): Chain IDs of the target protein (e.g., ["A"])
- **Binder Length** (`binderLength`): Length of the binder region to be designed. Can be a fixed length (e.g., "20") or a range to sample uniformly (e.g., "20-30")

### Optional Parameters
- **Hotspots** (`binderHotspots`): Specific residues on the target to focus on when designing the binder
- **Number of Designs** (`numDesigns`): Number of designs to generate (default: 1)
- **Verify** (`verify`): Whether to verify designs with MPNN and AlphaFold (default: true)

## Binder Redesign

The binder redesign task allows you to modify existing protein binders to improve their binding properties or alter their specificity. This can be useful for optimizing existing protein-protein interactions or adapting binders to new targets.

### Required Parameters
- **PDB File** (`pdbFile`): Input PDB file containing the binder/target complex
- **Binder Chain** (`binderChain`): Chain ID of the binder chain to be redesigned
- **Designed Residues** (`designedResidues`): Residues to be redesigned in the binder chain (format: ranges like "1-5, 7-10")
- **Designed Lengths** (`designedLengths`): Length specifications for each designed region, with lower and upper bounds for sampling

### Optional Parameters
- **Hotspot Chain** (`hotspotChain`): Chain to select residues to focus on
- **Hotspots** (`hotspots`): Specific residues to focus on during redesign
- **Number of Designs** (`numDesigns`): Number of designs to generate (default: 1)
- **Verify** (`verify`): Whether to verify designs with MPNN and AlphaFold (default: true)

## Motif Scaffolding

Motif scaffolding is a powerful application that enables the design of protein structures around specific functional motifs. This task allows you to preserve important structural or functional elements while generating novel surrounding protein architecture.

### Required Parameters
- **PDB File** (`pdbFile`): Input PDB file containing the structure
- **Interface Chain** (`interfaceChain`): Chain ID of the chain with interface to be scaffolded
- **Interface Residues** (`interfaceResidues`): Residues to be scaffolded (format: ranges like "10-20,30-40")
- **Designed Lengths** (`designedLengths`): Length specifications for each designed region

### Optional Parameters
- **Number of Designs** (`numDesigns`): Number of designs to generate (default: 1)
- **Verify** (`verify`): Whether to verify designs with MPNN and AlphaFold (default: true)

## Partial Diffusion

Partial diffusion is a specialized task that allows you to perform diffusion-based design on specific regions of a protein while keeping other parts fixed. This is particularly useful when you want to maintain certain structural elements while redesigning others.

### Required Parameters
- **PDB File** (`pdbFile`): Input PDB file containing the structure
- **Designed Chain** (`designedChain`): Chain ID of the chain to be designed
- **Diffused Residues** (`diffusedResidues`): Residues to be diffused (format: ranges like "1-5, 7-10")

### Optional Parameters
- **Partial Diffusion Temperature** (`partial_T`): Temperature parameter for the diffusion process
- **Number of Designs** (`numDesigns`): Number of designs to generate (default: 1)
- **Verify** (`verify`): Whether to verify designs with MPNN and AlphaFold (default: true)
