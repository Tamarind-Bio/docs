IgDesign (https://app.tamarind.bio/tools/igdesign) is an in-vitro validated tool to redesign antibodies in complex with antigens, which produces increased binding affinity by redesigning CDR regions. Our recommendation to optimize an antibody/VHH binder bound to an antigen would be to use IgDesign. 

We would recommend running IgDesign with 1M sequences (1000 batches) and taking the top 100 CDR designs based on the lowest ce_loss.

The following are binding rates across antigens for IgDesign on HCDR3 and HCDR123 as well as SAbDab HCDR3 baseline.
| Antigen  | IgDesign (HCDR3)     | IgDesign (HCDR123)   | SAbDab (HCDR3)    |
|----------|----------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Antigen 1| 30.6% (22/72)       | 6.3% (4/64)          | 1.6% (1/61)       |
| IL36R    | 27.9% (19/68)       | 15.6% (5/32)         | 1.6% (1/68)       |
| C5       | 53.8% (14/26)       | 61.5% (8/13)         | 16.7% (1/6)       |
| TSLP     | 96.3% (52/54)       | 92.2% (47/51)        | 88.1% (37/42)     |
| IL17A    | 56.3% (9/16)        | 0.0% (0/8)           | 12.5% (1/8)       |
| FXI      | 61.5% (32/52)       | 49.0% (24/49)        | 20.0% (1/5)       |
| ACVR2B   | 53.3% (16/30)       | 9.4% (3/32)          | 0.0% (0/9)        |
| TNFRSF9  | 22.4% (15/67)       | 24.3% (9/37)         | 6.3% (2/32)       |
