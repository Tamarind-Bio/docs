ChemNet is a graph neural network that generates atomic-level structures of protein-small molecule systems. It reconstructs structures from corrupted inputs and builds structures for docking, enabling rapid generation of conformational ensembles. In wet lab validation, it significantly improved enzyme design, producing a retroaldolase with a kcat/KM of 11000 M-1min-1 - higher than any pre-deep learning design for this reaction.
