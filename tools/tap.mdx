Immunogenicity, instability, self-association, high viscosity, polyspecificity, or poor expression can all preclude an antibody from becoming a therapeutic. Early identification of these negative characteristics is essential. Akin to the Lipinski guidelines, which measure druglikeness in small molecules, our Therapeutic Antibody Profiler(TAP) highlights antibodies that possess characteristics that are rare/unseen in clinical-stage mAb therapeutics. The only required input is the variable domain sequence. We show examples where our approach would have advised against manufacturing antibodies that were found to aggregate or have poor expression.

TAP makes a model of the structure of a given ScFv or VHH sequence and comparing its charge (and symetry of these charges) to clinical-stage antibodies. On Tamarind, we provide thresholds, which, if passed, show that the properties of the input antibody matches that of therapeutic antibodies.
