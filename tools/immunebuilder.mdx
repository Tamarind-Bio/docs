ImmuneBuilder is a collection of tools for predicting structures of Nanobodies, Antibodies, and T-Cell receptors. Note that these not bound to the antigen, i.e. it would predict the structure of the ScFv or VHH without a target present. It is much faster than comparable models like AlphaFold, while maintaining its state of the art accuracy.

For example, on a benchmark of 34 recently solved antibodies, ABodyBuilder2 predicts CDR-H3 loops with an RMSD of 2.81Å, a 0.09Å improvement over AlphaFold-Multimer, while being over a hundred times faster. Similar results are also achieved for nanobodies, (predicts CDR-H3 loops with an average RMSD of 2.89Å, a 0.55Å improvement over AlphaFold2) and TCRs. By predicting an ensemble of structures, ImmuneBuilder also gives an error estimate for every residue in its final prediction.
