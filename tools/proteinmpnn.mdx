ProteinMPNN is a deep learning-based protein sequence design method that significantly outperforms traditional approaches like Rosetta, achieving 52.4% sequence recovery compared to Rosetta's 32.9%. It can design sequences for single or multiple chains and has been experimentally validated through X-ray crystallography, cryoEM, and functional studies. The method has successfully designed various protein types including monomers, cyclic homo-oligomers, and target binding proteins, representing a major advancement in computational protein design.

ProteinMPNN is often used after RFdiffusion to generate sequences for a given designed structure. It can also be used given a starting structure to generate stabalizing mutations.
