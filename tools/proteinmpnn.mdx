### Design a sequence to fold into a protein structure
  
ProteinMPNN significantly outperforms traditional approaches like Rosetta, achieving 52.4% sequence recovery. It can design sequences for single or multiple chains and has been experimentally validated through X-ray crystallography, cryoEM, and functional studies. The method has successfully designed various protein types including monomers, cyclic homo-oligomers, and target binding proteins, representing a major advancement in computational protein design.
  
ProteinMPNN is often used after RFdiffusion to generate sequences for a given designed structure, since RFdiffusion/RFantibody will design structures with poly-Gs as placeholders for designed residues. It can also be used directly from a starting structure to generate stabilizing mutations.

### Inputs
- PDB File
- Designed Residues - select residues on each chain to be designed
- Temperature: adjust the amount of diversity in your sequences. Higher value will generate more mutations. 

### Outputs
- Overall Confidence: Average over all redesigned residues (exp[-mean_over_residues(log_probs)]) - higher means more confident

### Alternative weights
  
Others have finetuned ProteinMPNN for different use cases. You can use the following weights by changing the "Model Type" parameter:
- SolubleMPNN - trained on soluble proteins
- AbMPNN - trained on antibodies
- HyperMPNN - trained on hyperthermophilic proteins
- LigandMPNN - takes ligand atoms into account
  
You can also check out ThermoMPNN (uses ProteinMPNN embeddings to identify thermostable point mutations).
