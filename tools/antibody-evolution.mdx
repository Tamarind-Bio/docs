title: Antibody Evolution
description: 'Point mutations to improve binding affinity'
---

This research demonstrates how protein language models can effectively guide antibody evolution without requiring specific information about target antigens or protein structure. By suggesting evolutionarily plausible mutations, the models successfully improved binding affinities of both mature and unmatured antibodies through minimal laboratory screening (20 or fewer variants across two rounds). The approach achieved up to sevenfold improvements for mature antibodies and up to 160-fold improvements for unmatured antibodies, while maintaining favorable thermostability and viral neutralization activity. Notably, the same models proved effective across diverse protein families and selection pressures, suggesting broad applicability beyond antibody optimization.
